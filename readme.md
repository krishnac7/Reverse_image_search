# Feature Extraction and Reverse Image Search on Caltech-101 Dataset
This notebook will guide you through the process of analyzing an image dataset using a pre-trained convolution network (VGG16) and extracting feature vectors for each image

Post analysis we try to demonstrate 'reverse image search' one of the widely popular applications of image analysis.

# Flow:
* Download [VGG16 pre-trained model](https://keras.io/applications/#vgg16) using keras

* Perform Feature Extraction :
  >Here we remove the last layer ie.,the softmax classification layer so our output model now has only 12 layers and the last layer would be fc2(Dense) a fully connected layer
  
* Get feature vectors for all the images then scale them down using [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)

* Use cosine distance between pca features to compare the query image to 5 number of closest images and return them as thumbnails

# Steps:

# Deploy on IBM Cloud:


* Sign up for IBM's [Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/). By creating a project in Watson Studio a free tier ``Object Storage`` service will be created in your IBM Cloud account. Take note of your service names as you will need to select them in the following steps.

* If you are running it on cpu and have decided to reduce the image dataset size you may end up with reduced prediction accuracy

> Note: When creating your Object Storage service, select the ``Free`` storage type in order to avoid having to pay an upgrade fee.

* Create a new Project in Watson Studio (New --> Standard project)

* Create a GPU Environment (Environment --> New Environment --> GPU Beta)

* Create a new Notebook (Add to project --> Notebook --> from url)
* Provision the notebook on newly created GPU Environment

* Stop the Environment Post usage

# Run Locally:
* Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/krishnac7/Reverse_image_search.git
```

* Navigate into the directory

```
cd Reverse_image_search-master
```

* Run using Jupyter notebooks

```
jupyter notebook
```
